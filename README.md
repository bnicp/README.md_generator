## Description

This project is a command line node interface tool that generates a README file based on user repsonses to specific prompts. It will automatically fill in: title, description, installation and usage instructions, license, ways to contribute, sample tests, and methods of contact for further questions.

This is an excellent tool to save time on README file structure by simply inputting information about your project without having to worry about formatting.

The activity helped to teach me much more about Node and CLI and how they can save time by creating automated processes.
